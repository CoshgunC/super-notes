Guys idk why, but my app redirectes to /todos and not /dashboard after auth. Even though I manually type /dashboard, it still redirects to /todos. I dont why, but it happens. I have corrected every ("/todos") I could find, but still. _Note_: I have copied some of the backend's code from [Supatodo](https://github.com/jolbol1/Supatodo)
